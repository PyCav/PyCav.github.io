<p>The goal of PyCav is to unify computing in the Cambridge undergraduate Physics course under a single framework based on the Python programming language.</p>

PyCav consists of four streams:

<ul>

<li><a href="https://github.com/PyCav/Demos">Demonstrations</a> for use in lectures, in the form of <a href="https://github.com/PyCav/Demos">Jupyter notebooks</a>.
</li>

<li><a href="https://nile.pycav.org">A JupyterHub server</a> to host these demos, and provide solutions or hints for student self-evaluation.
</li>

 <li><a href="https://github.com/PyCav/Investigations">Investigations</a>  related to some of our major Physics lecture courses, allowing students to explore and visualize complex physical phenomena beyond the analytic examples given in lectures.
</li>

<li> Tools for <a href="https://github.com/PyCav/Data">data</a> gathering, analysis, and plotting for use in the practical classes.
</li>
</ul>

Funding is provided by the [teaching and learning innovation fund](http://www.cctl.cam.ac.uk/support-and-training/funding/teaching-and-learning-innovation-fund).
