<h1>PyCav </h1>

<p>The goal of PyCav is to unify computing in the Cambridge undergraduate Physics course under a single framework based on the Python programming language.</p>

PyCav consists of four streams:

<ul>

<li><a href="https://github.com/PyCav/Demos">Demonstrations</a> for use in lectures, in the form of <a href="https://github.com/PyCav/Demos">Jupyter notebooks</a>.
</li>

<li><a href="https://pycav.ovh">A JupyterHub server</a> to host these demos, and provide solutions or hints for student self-evaluation.
</li>

 <li><a href="https://github.com/PyCav/Investigations">Investigations</a>  related to some of our major Physics lecture courses, allowing students to explore and visualize complex physical phenomena beyond the analytic examples given in lectures.
</li>

<li> Tools for <a href="https://github.com/PyCav/Data">data</a> gathering, analysis, and plotting for use in the practical classes.
</li>
</ul>

The PyCav team are Aidan Crilly, Sam Garrett, Taketomo Isazawa, Jordan Osborn and Niall McConville.

PyCav is run by Austen Lamacraft and John Richer, with financial support from the teaching and learning innovation fund.
