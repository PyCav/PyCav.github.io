Our demo server [Nile](https://nile.pycav.org) is now up and running and ready for you to try. Authenticate via Raven and have a play with any of the demos that the team have been working on.

Inside the demos directory you will find a IPython notebook `index.ipynb`, which gives links to the demo notebooks and a short description of each.

We want your comments, and suggestions for more demos!
